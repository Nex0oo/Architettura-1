# Architettura-1
This repo contains a small project done by me on logisim for the course "Archiettura degli elaboratori 1" at the University of Milan. I made a simplified version of the famous game "Flappy bird".

### Project start-up
- Download the program "Logisim"
- Open the project and select, under "simulate," as tick frequency 8Hz
- Select "simulation enabled" and then click on "tick enabled"
